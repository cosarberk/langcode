# langcode
A Plugin-Based Framework for Managing and Using LangChain


langcode is a plugin-based framework that enables modular management and usage of all LangChain features. It can be considered a code-based alternative to LangFlow, but without a visual flow builder. Instead, it allows you to invoke and integrate LangChain’s existing capabilities as independent plugins quickly and efficiently.

✔ Flexible and modular: Use only the LangChain components you need by calling the relevant plugins.
✔ Fast integration: Instead of manually defining complex LangChain structures, quickly adapt them using the built-in plugin system.
✔ Minimal structure: Load only the necessary components, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.

langcode provides the power of LangChain in a more organized, easily manageable, and extensible way.
